# I had a crummy day today, then I did comedy, and immediately felt amazing and like my day wasn't a waste.  I don't know why this surprises me every time.

I find that I rediscover things continually.  I don't mean this in a whimsical, cute way--it's a bit embarassing.  Like tonight, I finished up 10 minutes of stage time and left the building and tried to process the feelings I was having: "It's like the depression I had earlier is gone, "I thought, " The worries I had were overtaken by this desire to tell jokes well, and then when I got the laughter, it's all I could think about and now the lightness is what's staying in my head."  I walked to the train, trying to unpack this: "I find that I feel happy because I am just thinking and feeling that lightness from before." Then it came to me in a flash, "YOU ENJOY DOING STANDUP.  YOU JUST DID THE THING YOU LOVE AND NOW YOU FEEL HAPPY BECAUSE OF IT."    It's slightly worrisome that I forget this stuff so easily, but it's also nice to rediscover your passions every time you do them.

I know I'm not the only person for whom this happens.  Our days are filled with so much noise, stresses,and novel anxieties, that the simple things can get muddied out of mind.  But they still exist, waiting to be thought of again.  I think that every day, someone, somewhere, reinvents the ice cream sandwich.  They have an incredible craving, they look at the random snacks in their kitchen, and stumble upon a brilliant combination.  And every day, someone, somewhere in the world, must be listening to their friend excitedly describe this culinary breakthrough, and has to say, "yeah dude, i'm sorry, it just sounds like you made a what's-it."   Once every few weeks, a new band discovers that their song sounds much better with hand claps.  And it seems natural to us the listeners, but to the person suggesting the clapping it must feel like alchemy.

And while it is great that I get to rediscover the happy things, it sucks that I forget them so easily.  .  Once every few months I travel through a slump, and while in this fog, I so easily accept the world as awful garbage.     Life is obviously dumb, I think, and the days are meant to be hard.  Sometimes, I will have a flash of awareness and realize, "oh! I'm depressed!", but then forget that the depression is a cloud that will leave me.  Instead I just believe that this bout of sadness is a new, indestructible version and even though it follows all previous versions' patterns, this will be the sadness that won't leave.  

I knew I was in a slump that morning on the train when I got angry at a baby.  It was being held by his mom, and he was looking at me, but the baby's eyes were too soft a blue that I thought that seemed snobby.  Just to be clear on my mood: I saw a baby on the subway,  thought the baby's eyes were too nice of a blue, and because of how nice of a blue they were thought the baby must be looking down on me, and that made me angry.  

When I get into a bad mood, I get all these irrational dislikes.   I become like an angry grampa who is from such a remote time and place, that his prejudices seem otherworldly.  Who says things like, "all plumbers are thieves, and that's why they wear such loose jeans" and you don't know how to unwrap or understand any part of that anger.  

Tonight I hung out in the Lower East side in a funk.  I went to a book store and got angry at how it smelled too much like books and it seemed annoyingly obvious.  Then I went to Otto's Shrunken Head and was upset that there was a rockabilly show before the comedy show, and I internally yelled at the rockabilly crowd, "why don't you stop going to show and just go back home and be good fathers." Because I had this unknown prejudice that anyone who likes rockabilly is a young father, and a bad young father.  

Then, during the comedy show, a comedian took the stage and made a joke referencing funeral services, and I got mad at morticians. "Soft handed fucks," I thought angrily.  I never realized I had a hatred towards morticians, OR people with soft hands until tonight.

But then I went onstage, and all my prejudices against soft-hands and book smells and rockabillers dissolved.

I am glad tonight I got to relearn that the thing I came to the city to do makes me happy.  It's important, maybe, to write down the things that guarantee happiness for me.  And not like, "a secure future achieving my dreams" cos that shit's intangible.   But, eating breakfast and good sleep makes me happy.  Going on runs and having a clean room and doing yoga makes me happy.  Giving myself time for writing, socializing, and magic makes me happy.  Performing and having new things to perform makes me happy.  The inevitable winning over a funk makes me happy too.  And now I hope that by writing it down, I won't have to remember these things all the time too.
