# A collection of mixed metaphors and pure, sincere hellos.
![By Angelica Blevins](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3029ba60-750b-47d0-82cf-e6b269d8b916.jpg)

So welcome my newest collection of  tossed off half thoughts stored permanently, of webpages waiting to become  memories! 

I am starting this post on a day when I feel overwhelmed by computers.  My face and limbs are sore with internet.  I stared at a twitter feed about a tragedy for too long and then went to facebook to see what stupid stuff my old high school friends were saying about it and it was just a bad, abusive combination.   I realized I was doing absolutely nothing.  I was learning nothing, I was contributing and creating nothing.  I was only amplifying a mix of anger and grief in my head, feeding both emotions to make them rise into a horrible roar of feelings, a rage without articulation.  It was awful, it was offensively impotent, and I  had to stop and  step away.  I closed my laptop, I stood up and stretched, and then I opened it back up, but moved to this page.

The old cures don't work anymore.  The "Step away and read a book! Then climb a tree! Then find a cat in a window and just stare at it until you feel human again!" methods doesn't work, because it assumes the internet is some substitution for the real world and If you just return to reality you'll feel good again.

But the internet isn't a substitution, it is just part of the real world.  It's as much of a living presence as any tree or good cat.  Of course you can turn everything off and sit on the grass and read a nice book, but you'll want to tell someone about the book once you're done with it, and the best place for discussion will be  online.  Or maybe you'll start a book club and invite your best friends and you'll all meet face to face with sharp haircuts and finger sandwiches and discuss, but the arrangement of this face to face will happen online too.  So if you try to just move away from the internet, you are moving away from a section of reality.   A section that is vibrant, alive, full of people talking and creating and learning.  It is a part of our living world.

But so is Pittsburgh.  And I feel totally okay with my life knowing that I'll probably never visit Pittsburgh.  And so is that Arby's in Westside Olympia where, every time you visit, it looks like the entire staff just got done crying.  And I'm totally okay with never visiting that place again.

I don't want to go offline, in the same way I don't want to leave this earth.  I like this world,  I just need to change the places I visit.  

In the physical world I have an amazing neighborhood and routine.  I live in a fantastic city with awesome friends, and we go to cool-ass bookstores and create great shows, and my nice-ass apartment is a short bike away from my yoga place which is also my coffee shop which is also my experimental metal concert venue with a great outdoor patio.  

Online, I visit 2 places repeatedly.  One is a  coffee shop where all my high school buddies gather and loudly shout their opinions on race while waving hand-written articles they found and I sit in a corner and scoff.

The other is a bar where a bunch of comedians riff  aggressively on the latest tragedies of the day while racist strangers yell to get my attention and a dear friend sobs about the injustices she's facing and I listen for hours and then just go home.  

My online neighborhood is awful.  A digital Arby's.  And not only is it awful, but I can't stop visiting it.  I visit even when I'm pooping.  "Okay," I'll think, "I have five quiet minutes.  I better make sure the racists are there and my friend's still sobbing.  Yep! I'm ready to face the day again."

This online routine is entirely my creation though.  None of it is the internet's fault, just like shitty eating habits and terrible friends are not the natural world's fault.  And I want to have an online life, because I've got cool friends, who are spread out over too many cities for me to visit easily.  and there's so many interesting strangers I want to meet, and I  just finished a good book and I desperately wanna talk about it.  So instead of trying to check out, I will interact with it all differently.   And for change to work,  it must begin at home.    

So welcome to this new blog, a place that I hope is as pleasant as a nice tree on a calm street, next to a house with a good cat who just hangs out in the window waiting for you to visit it.
