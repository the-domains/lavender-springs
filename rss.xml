            <title><![CDATA[I had a crummy day today, then I did comedy, and immediately felt amazing and like my day wasn't a waste.  I don't know why this surprises me every time.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1></h1><p>I find that I rediscover things continually.  I don't mean this in a whimsical, cute way--it's a bit embarassing.  Like tonight, I finished up 10 minutes of stage time and left the building and tried to process the feelings I was having: "It's like the depression I had earlier is gone, "I thought, " The worries I had were overtaken by this desire to tell jokes well, and then when I got the laughter, it's all I could think about and now the lightness is what's staying in my head."  I walked to the train, trying to unpack this: "I find that I feel happy because I am just thinking and feeling that lightness from before." Then it came to me in a flash, "YOU ENJOY DOING STANDUP.  YOU JUST DID THE THING YOU LOVE AND NOW YOU FEEL HAPPY BECAUSE OF IT."    It's slightly worrisome that I forget this stuff so easily, but it's also nice to rediscover your passions every time you do them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b0052fe3266ea0415ba7e1101e98724528ee4aff.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A collection of mixed metaphors and pure, sincere hellos.</h1><p>I've now lived long enough, at the right time, to become nostalgic of blogs.  My blogs specifically.  I started with Diaryland, with nothing but some teen sadness, song lyrics, and a crush.  Then I moved to the bigger, brighter, more intimidating livejournal.  I grew up and wanted to be more professional, so I moved to Wordpress, then Squarespace, and now here I am on the beta of a new site, writing on a platform that doesn't exist yet, hoping that it will be here that I can build my home.  I've got a decade of peersonal thoughts published mid-gathering.  And because nothing in the internet goes away, I can revisit all my old sites and cringing entries like they're sweatshirts in a closets, stained with memory-laden paint, printed with the graphic of some past event I was proud to be a part of.  I have always and will always love this.  </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3a3abdf4-3040-410b-a624-36c091df393a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
